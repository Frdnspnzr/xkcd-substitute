xkcd-substitute
===============

Simple javascript replacing words based on [this xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1288/).

It's hilarious but not very well executed. It is pretty slow and there's much copypaste involved. It's hard to add words or use another word list or, well, do anything. If anybody, including me, would have the time to awesomeize this that'd be great! Meanwhile, feel free to laugh at "Tesla Motors first built an atomic sports cat, the Tesla Roadster".

## How to use
Add this as a bookmark in your browser, click whenever you really need some giggles.
```
javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://raw.github.com/Friedenspanzer/xkcd-substitute/master/substitute.js';})();
```
You may or may not feel like trying it out on [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk).
